# Documentation Grove Instructions

Within this `docs/` grove, every artifact must braid the tri-layer cadence—formal derivation, empirical resonance, metaphorical echo—without privileging one voice over the others.  When introducing concepts:

- **Always foreground the threshold quartet** \((R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))\) and articulate how the logistic response \(\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\) signals regime change.
- **Cross-link to evidence** in `analysis/`, solvers in `models/`, and experiences in `simulator/` so that readers can traverse the full RepoPlan 2.0 circuit.
- **Frame falsifiability** by contrasting resonance claims with at least one smooth null scenario, even in narrative prose.
- **Let symbolism breathe.** Preserve the poetic lexicon seeded in `Docs/` (membranes, dawn choruses, luminous thresholds) while keeping mathematical statements precise.

When adding new subdirectories under `docs/`, mirror this AGENT file or extend it with more specific guidance.
