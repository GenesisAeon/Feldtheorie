# Bio-cultural Buffering: Community Firebreak Thresholds

## Formal Membrane Covenant
We model community firebreak stewardship as a logistic gate \(\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\) where the control parameter \(R\) denotes the maintained mosaic of agroforestry corridors. Analysis of the coupled membrane exported from [`models/membrane_solver.py`](../../models/membrane_solver.py) and calibrated against the rainforest resonance fit sets the activation threshold at \(\Theta = 0.621\) with steepness \(\beta = 14.02\). The impedance switch \(\zeta(R) = 1.8 - 0.6\,\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\) softens wind-driven ignition before \(\Theta\) and stiffens once the logistic crest ignites, locking in a resonant suppression band that aligns with the RepoPlan 2.0 expectation of a universal threshold field.

## Empirical Resonance Ledger
The socio-ecological dataset [`data/socio_ecology/amazon_resilience.csv`](../../data/socio_ecology/amazon_resilience.csv) traces canopy retention against restoration cadence, with metadata distilled in [`data/socio_ecology/amazon_resilience.metadata.json`](../../data/socio_ecology/amazon_resilience.metadata.json). Fitting the logistic response via [`analysis/amazon_resilience_fit.py`](../../analysis/amazon_resilience_fit.py) and archiving results in [`analysis/results/amazon_resilience_fit.json`](../../analysis/results/amazon_resilience_fit.json) recovers \(\Theta = 0.621\) and \(\beta = 14.02\) with \(R^2 = 0.999\). Smooth null companions—linear and power-law curves logged in the metadata—trail with \(\Delta \mathrm{AIC} > 60\), satisfying the falsifiability mandate. The same pipeline, when aimed at [`data/socio_ecology/urban_heat_canopy.csv`](../../data/socio_ecology/urban_heat_canopy.csv) through [`analysis/urban_heat_canopy_fit.py`](../../analysis/urban_heat_canopy_fit.py), maps an urban tree-canopy threshold \(\Theta = 0.313\) with \(\beta = 15.27\) and \(R^2 = 0.999\), revealing how municipal corridors echo the forest membrane resonance.

## Metaphorical Dawn Chorus
Communal firebreaks behave like braided membranes: below \(\Theta\), embers roam as whispers across the savanna-forest seam; above \(\Theta\), the corridor choir inhales moisture and releases cooling shade. The impedance gate \(\zeta(R)\) is the collective vigilance of guardians tending agroforestry mosaics, bending policy levers and cultural ceremonies into a living firewall. This scroll invites the simulator guild to cast these resonances into sliders for stewardship councils, while the `paper/` scriptorium can quote its null-defying ledger as ethical ballast for justice-centered climate transitions.
