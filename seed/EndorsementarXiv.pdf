Who is qualified to endorse?

To endorse another user to submit to the nlin.AO (Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems) subject class, an arXiv submitter must have submitted 4 papers to any of nlin.AO, nlin.CD, nlin.CG, nlin.PS or nlin.SI earlier than three months ago and less than five years ago.

You can find out if a particular person is qualified to endorse by looking up one or more of their articles and clicking on the link "Which of the authors of this article can endorse?" at the bottom of the abstract.
