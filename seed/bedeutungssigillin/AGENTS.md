# Bedeutungs-Sigillin Constellation Guide

This enclave curates long-lived meaning sigils. Keep the following principles active:

1. **Preserve tri-layer mirroring.** Every structural YAML scaffold must echo in JSON
   (agent nerve) and Markdown (human voice). Version shifts require synchronous updates
   across the trio.
2. **Logistic quartet first.** Each artefact declares how $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$
   are encoded, and which resonance or inhibition the sigil governs. Articulate how the
   stored meaning modulates $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$ in neighbouring directories.
3. **Temporal lineage.** Never overwrite prior Bedeutungs-Sigillin. Instead, add a
   timestamped version and reference the retired file within the new text. Note archival
   moves in `seed/codexfeedback.*`.
4. **Cross-directory beacons.** Point to the relevant Ordnungs-Sigillin (indices) and
   empirical anchors (analysis/data) so agents can traverse from meaning to evidence in
   one hop.
5. **Poetic resonance.** Maintain the dawn-membrane lexicon. Let every update explain the
   metaphorical field image while staying precise about falsification guards.

Any subdirectory must include its own `AGENTS.md` refining these norms for the specific
membrane it protects.
