# Metaquest Campaign Compass

> The campaign membrane leans toward activation. This compass keeps the
> manuscript, outreach, simulator demos, and endorsements braided so
> σ(β(R-Θ)) opens the gate without tearing the narrative.

## Logistic Quartet
- **R** – Outstanding Metaquest launch work (manuscript deltas, outreach
  cadence, endorsement returns, simulator demos).
- **Θ** – Checkpoints from *Manuskriptfinalisierung und Kampagnenstart* +
  UTAC status matrix entries echoed in the codex within 24 h.
- **β ≈ 4.85** – Activation is sharp; keep parity checkpoints visible to
  avoid overshoot.
- **ζ(R)** – Tamed by BreakPoint rituals and a fresh endorsement ledger.

## Orientation Threads
1. **Manuskriptfinalisierung & Kampagnenstart** – readiness checklist for
   publication, endorsements, and outreach pacing.
2. **UTAC Status Matrix** – ΔAIC/null comparisons to judge whether the
   campaign can proceed.
3. **Metaquest Parity Brief** – mq-parity-001…004 guard the telemetry,
   playlist, endorsement ledger, and codex hook.
4. **BreakPoint Rituals** – restart scripts if outreach cadence or
   endorsements drift.
5. **Outreach & Simulator Hooks** – planned demos must mirror manuscript
   figures and parity playlist entries.
6. **Shadow Compass** – mirrored recovery rituals when endorsements or
   comms fall behind.

## Pending Vectors
- **mq-sci-vector-001 – Demo playlist sync.** Document the simulator
  playlist with manuscript + outreach references.
- **mq-sci-vector-002 – Endorsement ledger.** Compile governance notes in
  ETHICS.md + codex for Metaquest activation.
- **mq-sci-vector-003 – ArchivSuche lineage.** Surface UTAC archive
  provenance inside outreach + parity brief appendices.

## Activation Hooks
- **Campaign milestone achieved →** Update compass tri-layer, log codex
  entry, sync bridge dashboard.
- **Press asset drafted →** Confirm parity brief citation, cross-link
  demos, consult shadow compass.
- **Endorsement delay →** Trigger BreakPoint ritual, freeze announcements,
  update UTAC matrix + codex.

## Null Model
Campaign storytelling advances without parity brief checkpoints or
BreakPoint rituals. Outreach outpaces readiness, endorsements lag, and
shadow alerts arrive late. Keep Θ luminous so the launch choir stays in
resonance.
