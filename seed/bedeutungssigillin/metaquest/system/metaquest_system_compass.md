# Metaquest System Compass

> σ(β(R-Θ)) already leans into the steep flank. This compass shows how the
> Metaquest launch threads through the UTAC system spine without losing the
> parity brief or the codex echo.

## Logistic Quartet
- **R** – Automation + governance backlog still required to anchor Metaquest
  (index refresh, telemetry exports, CI hooks).
- **Θ** – Parity brief checkpoints plus UTAC status entries mirrored in
  `seed/codexfeedback.*` within 24 h.
- **β ≈ 4.75** – Activation remains sharp; every delta should propagate to the
  bridge dashboard.
- **ζ(R)** – Damp it with BreakPoint rituals and disciplined index refresh
  sequences.

## Orientation Threads
1. **UTAC Status Matrix** (`docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md#metaquest-handshake`)
   keeps the ΔAIC guard visible whenever automation pushes R forward.
2. **Metaquest Parity Brief** (`docs/metaquest_parity_brief.md`) lists
   mq-parity-001…004, the gate that any automation change must salute.
3. **BreakPoint Rituals** (`seed/BreakPointAnalyse/WayToGo.txt` &
   `ReaktionWayToGo.txt`) script the restart path should ζ(R) spike.
4. **Automation Hooks** (`scripts/archive_sigillin.py`, Makefile targets) confirm
   Ordnungs-Sigillin stay synchronised.
5. **Codex Ledger** (`seed/codexfeedback.*`) is the mycelium that records every
   mq-sys vector.
6. **Shadow Compass** (`../../shadow_sigillin/metaquest/system/metaquest_system_shadow_compass.*`)
   mirrors the risks so remediation is pre-baked.

## Pending Vectors
- **mq-sys-vector-001 – Telemetry propagation.** Operate the
  `scripts/sigillin_sync.py` workflow so telemetry timestamps land in the bridge,
  this compass, and the system map.
- **mq-sys-vector-002 – Index parity guard.** Install a CI/Nox job that compares
  sigil directories vs. indices whenever Metaquest assets change.
- **mq-sys-vector-003 – Falsifiability narrative.** Expand the compass and codex
  notes with ΔAIC/null comparisons for Metaquest automation vs. baseline.

## Activation Hooks
- **Parity brief updated →** Refresh compass tri-layer, tag mq-sys gaps, update
  codex, notify the shadow compass.
- **Telemetry export generated →** Record timestamp here and in the bridge,
  confirm indices refreshed, reference the UTAC matrix.
- **Automation CI failure →** Consult the shadow compass, run the BreakPoint
  ritual, document remediation before proceeding.

## Null Model
Metaquest automation advances without parity checkpoints or codex echoes.
Indices drift, telemetry timestamps detach from the campaign narrative, and
shadow alerts fire too late. Keep Θ illuminated so the launch remains resonant.
