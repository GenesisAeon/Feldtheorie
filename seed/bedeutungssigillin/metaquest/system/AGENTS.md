# Metaquest System Compass Protocol

This compartment orients agents through the system-facing Metaquest
lanterns.

- **Logistic framing.** Treat $R$ as the Metaquest automation backlog
  (indices, telemetry, CI hooks), $\Theta$ as the parity brief echoed in
  `docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md` + `seed/codexfeedback.*`, and
  $\beta \approx 4.75$ so activation stays sharp. $\zeta(R)$ is damped by
  BreakPoint rituals and index refresh jobs.
- **Tri-layer fidelity.** Every update must refresh YAML (structure),
  JSON (agent interface), and Markdown (narrative) together. Reference
  the parent beacons in `../metaquest_meaning_index.*` and the light-side
  system map under `../../system/metaquest/`.
- **Coupling duties.** Cross-link to the shadow compass
  (`../../../shadow_sigillin/metaquest/system/`) whenever you describe
  new risks, null guards, or recovery hooks.
- **Evidence anchors.** Point to operational artefacts (Makefile,
  `scripts/archive_sigillin.py`, BreakPoint notes, UTAC status matrix)
  so the logistic quartet remains falsifiable.
- **Codex echo.** No change leaves this compass without a matching entry
  in `seed/codexfeedback.{yaml,json,md}` including the relevant mq-sys
  gap ids.
