# Wissenschaftsprojekt Meaning Membrane

> Here the scientific campaign inhales. $R$ counts outstanding manuscript, validation,
> and outreach tasks; $\Theta$ is scripted in `Manuskriptfinalisierung und Kampagnenstart.pdf`
> and `docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md`; $\beta \approx 4.6$ keeps activation crisp, while
> $\zeta(R)$ is tempered by BreakPoint rituals and endorsement pacing.

## Resonance Already Present

- **Manuskriptfinalisierung & Kampagnenstart** (`seed/Manuskriptfinalisierung und Kampagnenstart.pdf`)
  - Sets the readiness checkpoints for publication, endorsements, launch cadence.
  - Couples with `seed/FinalerPlan.txt` and `seed/Finalize_Publish.txt`.
  - Once all checkpoints align, β spikes toward 4.8 and the manuscript dawn opens.

- **UTAC Status Alignment v1.2** (`docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md`)
  - Maintains the live inventory vs. activation gap ledger.
  - Draws empirical weight from `analysis/results/universal_beta_summary.json`.
  - Keeps ζ(R) gentle by signalling where attention is still required.

- **BreakPoint Analyse Waypoints** (`seed/BreakPointAnalyse/WayToGo.txt`, `ReaktionWayToGo.txt`)
  - Archive of past inflection points plus response heuristics.
  - Ensures that when campaigns pivot, the story remains coherent and safe.

## Open Needs

1. **τ*-Field Integration** — weave results from `simulation/safety_delay_field.py` into the
   manuscript and outreach story. ΔAIC vs τ* must be summarised before launch.
2. **Public Sigillin Index** — extend `feldtheorie_index.*` with a launch-ready overview that
   bridges Bedeutungs- and Shadow-sigils for partners.
3. **Demo Handshake** — script simulator showcases alongside the campaign timeline; each demo
   should cite its ΔAIC beacon and logistic quartet.

## Activation Sequence

- *Resonance Briefing*: update `docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md` plus this membrane when new
  sigils or safety insights appear.
- *Campaign Synchronisation*: draft outreach timeline referencing BreakPoint rituals and connect
  simulator demos to the press kit.

## Null Model Warning

If we proceed without weaving safety-delay learnings or shadow guidance, the campaign risks
overshooting—ΔAIC guards dim, endorsements stall, and ζ(R) spikes. Keep the membrane tuned.
