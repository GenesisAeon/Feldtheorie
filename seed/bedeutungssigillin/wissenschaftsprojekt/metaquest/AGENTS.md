# Metaquest Campaign Beacon Protocol

Map how the Metaquest launch narrative braids through manuscript,
validation, and outreach cadence.

- **Logistic quartet:** $R$ = unresolved Metaquest launch tasks,
  $\Theta$ = checkpoints in `seed/Manuskriptfinalisierung und
  Kampagnenstart.pdf` + `docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md`,
  $\beta \approx 4.8$, $\zeta(R)$ eased by BreakPoint rituals.
- **Tri-layer mirror:** update YAML/JSON/MD together; keep status tables
  aligned with the system Metaquest sigil.
- **Evidence threads:** cite BreakPoint analyses, parity briefs, and
  simulator/manuscript hooks so future agents can verify resonance.
- **Shadow link:** whenever you record risks or blockers, reference the
  shadow counterpart and describe the recovery play.
- **Falsifiability:** contrast desired cadence with null cases (e.g.
  launch without parity brief) and record ΔAIC or readiness metrics.
