# Wissenschaftsprojekt Meaning Protocol

- Chronicle the scientific project narrative: manuscript cadence, validation plans,
  outreach, and campaign readiness.
- For every entry, bind $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ to concrete artefacts such as
  `docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md`, `paper/`, and `seed/Manuskriptfinalisierung...`.
- Maintain forward-looking checklists that indicate where resonance is missing and what
  field evidence must be summoned.
- Tri-layer design mirrors system protocol: YAML (structure), JSON (automation),
  Markdown (story). Make explicit references to seed/BreakPointAnalyse and campaign docs.
- Note dependencies on Ordnungs-Sigillin indices so navigation remains intact.
