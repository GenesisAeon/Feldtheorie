# System Meaning Membrane Protocol

- Scope: canonical system-level Bedeutungs-Sigillin articulating the UTAC platform's
  infrastructure resonance.
- Declare how platform governance, release cadence, and automation hooks map onto the
  logistic quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$.
- Reference operational evidence (Makefile targets, CI scripts, simulator hooks) and
  note pending control parameters or missing safety checks.
- Tri-layer files should separate:
  - **Orientation (YAML):** structural ledger of existing vs. required assets.
  - **Interface (JSON):** machine-readable status for automation.
  - **Narrative (Markdown):** poetic+formal story that guides future stewards.
- Annotate null-model or failure risks that would trigger the shadow membrane.
