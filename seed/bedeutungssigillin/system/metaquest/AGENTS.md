# Metaquest System Beacon Protocol

This pocket sigil captures how the Metaquest launch threads through the
system backbone.

- **Logistic framing:** keep $R$ = Metaquest integration backlog,
  $\Theta$ = documented parity handshake across docs + codex,
  $\beta \approx 4.7$ for sharp activation, $\zeta(R)$ damped by
  automated index refresh.
- **Tri-layer discipline:** every update must land in YAML (skeleton),
  JSON (agent nerve), and Markdown (narrative) together.
- **Coupling duties:** reference `docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md`,
  `seed/BreakPointAnalyse/`, and the parent meaning membrane so agents
  can walk from Metaquest notes to operational evidence.
- **Shadow handshake:** cross-link the sibling shadow sigil and note
  which risks it mitigates whenever you change thresholds or hooks.
- **Null guards:** log outstanding automation or telemetry gaps and tie
  them to scripts (e.g. `scripts/sigillin_sync.py`) or CI plans.
