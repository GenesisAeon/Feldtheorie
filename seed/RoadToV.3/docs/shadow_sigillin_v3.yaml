# CLOSING STATEMENT
# ============================================================================

shadow_ethics:
  statement: |
    Shadow-Sigillin exists because **uncertainty is not weakness—it's honesty**.

    Every β-estimate has error bars. Every threshold has ambiguity.
    Every early warning signal has false positive risk.

    We document these not to undermine UTAC, but to **strengthen it**.

    Science advances by naming what it doesn't know.
    Warnings gain credibility by acknowledging limits.

    The shadows are not enemies—they're guardrails.

  final_reminder: |
    **Do not deploy V3 systems without:**
    1. Real data (not mock)
    2. Bootstrap CIs (not point estimates)
    3. Cascade coupling checks (not isolated systems)
    4. Communication protocols (not raw metrics)
    5. Shadow-Sigillin review (not blind confidence)

    **This is not alarmism. This is responsibility.**
