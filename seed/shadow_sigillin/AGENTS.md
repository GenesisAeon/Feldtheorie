# Shadow-Sigillin Safeguard Charter

Shadow sigils catalogue failure modes, impedance spikes, and negative resonance. Treat
this space as the repository's early-warning membrane:

1. **Couple to the light-side.** Every shadow record references its corresponding
   Bedeutungs-Sigillin sibling and states which control parameter $R$ risks overshooting
   $\Theta$.
2. **Quantify fragility.** Provide ΔAIC drops, $R^2$ erosion, or governance gaps that
   would force intervention. Keep evidence pointers precise.
3. **Actionability first.** Shadow entries must specify recovery steps, safety toggles,
   or archival rituals to restore equilibrium.
4. **Maintain tri-layer fidelity.** YAML = structure, JSON = machine alarm surface,
   Markdown = narrative of risk + poetic caution.
5. **Respect lineage.** Never delete historical incidents; append new versions and log
   them in `seed/codexfeedback.*`.

Subdirectories must define their own safety context via `AGENTS.md`.
