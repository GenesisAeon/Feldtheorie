incidents:
  - id: type6-shadow-001
    risk: 'Cubic root jump misidentified as measurement error.'
    symptom:
      - 'System exhibits β > 15 but attributed to "data noise" or "outlier"'
      - 'R ≈ Θ condition not recognized in analysis'
      - 'Cubic root formula β(R) ∝ ∛(R-Θ) not applied'
    consequence: 'High-β systems (Urban Heat, Amazon) dismissed as anomalies. Critical warnings missed before catastrophic phase transition.'
    mitigation:
      - 'Implement cubic root jump detection: check if R/Θ ratio ∈ [0.95, 1.05]'
      - 'Flag all β > 10 for mandatory cubic jump analysis'
      - 'Add Type-6 cubic jump model to analysis/utac_field_v1.2.py'

      - 'Attractor fixpoints (Φ, Φ², Φ³) not matching empirical clusters'
      - 'Rounding errors accumulate over 9-step sequence'
    consequence: 'Type-6 predictions fail. LLM emergence point (Φ³≈4.236) miscalculated. Scientific credibility damaged.'
    mitigation:
      - 'Use high-precision arithmetic: Python decimal.Decimal or mpmath'
      - 'Store Φ = (1+√5)/2 to 15+ significant digits'
      - 'Validate each step: |β_observed - β_theoretical| / β_theoretical < 0.01'

    symptom:
      - 'Activation curves increase with R instead of decreasing'
      - 'Implosive dynamics show expansion instead of compression'
      - 'Energy release E(t) negative or divergent'
    consequence: 'Type-6 simulation produces nonsensical results. Implosive genesis model invalidated.'

      - 'Note: Positive sign in exp() for inverted dynamics (NOT negative!)'
      - 'Add assertion: for R→∞, sigma_type6 → 0 (not 1)'

    symptom:
      - 'Papers/talks claim "universe began with implosion" as fact'
      - 'GN-z11 oxygen, Hubble tension cited as "proof" not "support"'
      - 'Falsifiability criteria not clearly stated'
    consequence: 'Scientific community rejects Type-6 as pseudoscience. UTAC credibility compromised.'

      - 'Confirmation bias: only reporting systems near Φ^(n/3) values'

    risk: 'Cubic root jump mechanism triggers catastrophic system collapse without warning.'
    symptom:
      - 'System approaches R≈Θ without damping intervention'
      - 'β accelerates from 4.2 to 16+ in single time step'
      - 'Feedback loop amplifies: high β → steeper threshold crossing → higher β'
    consequence: 'Real-world systems (climate, economy, AI) undergo uncontrolled phase transition. Societal harm.'
    mitigation:
      - 'Implement early warning system: flag when R/Θ > 0.9'
      - 'Increase ζ(R) damping near threshold: adaptive control'
      - 'Intervention strategies: reduce coupling C, increase Θ adaptively'

    monitoring:
      metric: 'R/Θ proximity alert'
      threshold: 'R/Θ > 0.9 → YELLOW, R/Θ > 0.95 → RED'
      validation: 'Intervention successfully prevents β > 15 in simulation'

  - id: type6-shadow-007
    risk: 'Philosophical/spiritual misinterpretation: Type-6 used to justify mysticism over science.'
    symptom:
      - '"Implosive genesis" cited as validation of religious creation myths'
      - 'Φ-spiral interpreted as "sacred geometry" proof'
      - 'Scientific rigor abandoned in favor of poetic resonance'
    consequence: 'UTAC dismissed by scientific community. Credibility loss. Cult formation risk.'
    mitigation:
      - 'Emphasize: Type-6 is mathematical model, not metaphysics'
      - 'Poetic layer (tri-layer) clearly marked as interpretive, not evidentiary'
      - 'Ancient wisdom citations are resonances, not validations'

      threshold: 'No mainstream publications conflate Type-6 with pseudoscience'
      validation: 'Scientific peer reviewers do not raise mysticism concerns'

    risk: 'Implosive dynamics create negative energy states or violate physical conservation laws.'
    symptom:
      - 'E(t) = ∫ σ(-β(R-Θ)) dR yields negative total energy'
      - 'ζ(R) < 0 persists indefinitely without physical mechanism'
      - 'Space generation from "nothing" violates quantum field theory'
    consequence: 'Type-6 incompatible with established physics. Model rejected as unphysical.'
    mitigation:
      - 'Clarify: ζ(R) < 0 is effective parameter, not fundamental force'
      - 'Implosion is geometric (topology change), not energetic (negative energy)'
      - 'Vacuum energy already permits "creation from nothing" (quantum fluctuations)'
      - 'Consult theoretical physicists for compatibility check with QFT/GR'
    monitoring:
      metric: 'Physics consistency'

      - 'σ(-β(R-Θ)) not actually inverted in simulation'
      - 'Φ^(1/3) scaling absent in beta_spiral_implosion.py'
    consequence: 'Type-6 exists in name only. Scientific claims not backed by implementation.'
