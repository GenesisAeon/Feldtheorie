# Metaquest Campaign Shadow Compass

> The campaign lantern needs a mirror. This compass lists the alarms and
> recovery rituals that keep σ(β(R-Θ)) stable when outreach races ahead
> of readiness.

## Logistic Guard
- **R** – Outreach/manuscript blockers, endorsement latency, demo drift.
- **Θ** – Parity brief + BreakPoint ritual echo + codex entry inside
  24 h.
- **β ≈ 5.0** – Alerts must ignite quickly.
- **ζ(R)** – Swells when endorsements or rituals stall.

## Alerts
- **mq-sci-shadow-001 – Parity citation missing.** Freeze announcements,
  amend assets with parity brief reference, update compass/bridge/codex.
- **mq-sci-shadow-002 – Endorsement ledger stale.** Refresh ETHICS/ledger,
  update UTAC matrix, run BreakPoint ritual.
- **mq-sci-shadow-003 – Playlist drift.** Realign simulator demos,
  outreach assets, and manuscript references; log codex status.
- **mq-sci-shadow-004 – ArchivSuche omission.** Restore archive citations
  in outreach + parity brief appendices, record ΔAIC/null guard.

## Playbooks
1. **mq-sci-shadow-001** → Pause comms, add parity citation, re-run
   BreakPoint ritual, log codex correction.
2. **mq-sci-shadow-002** → Gather endorsements, refresh ledger, update
   UTAC matrix before resuming comms.
3. **mq-sci-shadow-003** → Synchronise playlist + assets, cite update in
   codex, confirm manuscript figures referenced.
4. **mq-sci-shadow-004** → Append ArchivSuche references, inform bridge,
   archive remediation notes with timestamps.

Mirror every mitigation back to the light-side compass and bridge index
so campaign readiness stays legible.
