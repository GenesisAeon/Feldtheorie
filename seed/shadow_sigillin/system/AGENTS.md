# System Shadow Protocol

- Track infrastructure regressions: CI failure streaks, automation drift, release gate
  decay.
- State the triggering threshold where $R$ (unmitigated technical debt) overcomes
  $\Theta$ (tolerable drift) and how $\beta$ steepens once incidents compound.
- Connect every alert to remediation levers (scripts, tests, governance docs) and mirror
  the matching Bedeutungs-Sigillin entry.
- Tri-layer outputs must enable rapid machine monitoring and human judgement.
