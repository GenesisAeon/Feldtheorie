# Metaquest System Shadow Guard

Track failure signals that threaten the Metaquest-system handshake.

- **Logistic framing:** $R$ = unattended Metaquest automation drift,
  $\Theta$ = documented parity run + codex echo, $\beta \approx 5.2$,
  $\zeta(R)$ spikes when telemetry is silent.
- **Tri-layer mandate:** maintain YAML/JSON/MD parity for every alert.
- **Coupling:** reference the light-side Metaquest system sigil and note
  which remediation restores $\Theta$.
- **Evidence hooks:** cite scripts, CI plans, and UTAC status entries so
  responders can trigger fixes immediately.
- **Lineage:** do not delete past incidents; append with timestamps and
  log codex references for each escalation.
