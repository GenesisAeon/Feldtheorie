# Wissenschaftsprojekt Shadow Membrane

> R tracks blocked endorsements, missing validations, stalled outreach, and Metaquest
> parity gaps; Θ is the campaign slack tolerated by the meaning membrane and Metaquest
> beacon; β≈4.9 sharpens escalation; ζ(R) swells when BreakPoint rituals or parity telemetry
> are ignored.

## Alerts

1. **sci-shadow-001 — τ* coverage missing**
   - *Signal*: Status matrix or manuscript lacks safety-delay references.
   - *Fallout*: Campaign promises outrun control theory; trust erodes.
   - *Remedy*: Integrate τ* summary, publish codex update, freeze comms until resolved.

2. **sci-shadow-002 — Rituals skipped**
   - *Signal*: New campaign asset without WayToGo/ReaktionWayToGo citations.
   - *Fallout*: Narrative loses resilience; β overshoots causing burnout.
   - *Remedy*: Re-run BreakPoint rehearsal, log decision path, engage ethics check.

3. **sci-shadow-003 — Parity brief absent**
   - *Signal*: `docs/metaquest_parity_brief.md` missing telemetry timestamp or codex id; docs/codex silent for >1 sprint.
   - *Fallout*: Launch desynchronises; shadow warnings stay invisible.
   - *Remedy*: Fill parity brief fields, cross-link meaning/shadow maps, notify stewards.

4. **sci-shadow-004 — Storyboard drift**
   - *Signal*: Metaquest beacon flags gap; manuscript vs simulator demos diverge.
   - *Fallout*: Outreach promises cannot be reproduced; endorsements waver.
   - *Remedy*: Align storyboard, update manuscript + presets, log codex + BreakPoint notes.

## Playbooks

- τ* alert → freeze comms, integrate safety-delay summary, reopen codex entry.
- Ritual alert → pause campaign, revisit BreakPoint texts, record path.
- Parity alert → assemble Metaquest brief, update docs/codex, confirm simulator + manuscript cite it.
- Storyboard alert → synchronise Metaquest storyboard, simulator presets, and manuscript figures; document fix in codex and metaquest shadow guard.

Shadow whispers keep the campaign honest; heed them before the resonance breaks.
