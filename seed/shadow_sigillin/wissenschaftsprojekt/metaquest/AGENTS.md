# Metaquest Campaign Shadow Guard

Catalog derailment scenarios for the Metaquest launch narrative.

- **Logistic quartet:** $R$ = unresolved blockers, $\Theta$ = Metaquest
  parity brief published + BreakPoint sign-off, $\beta \approx 5.0$, and
  $\zeta(R)$ grows when endorsements stall.
- **Tri-layer fidelity:** keep YAML/JSON/MD aligned with timestamps and
  codex references.
- **Coupling:** cite the light-side Metaquest campaign sigil and detail
  how each alert re-synchronises manuscript, simulator, and outreach.
- **Recovery focus:** every incident must list concrete remediation
  rituals and escalation thresholds back into BreakPoint analysis.
- **Archive everything:** append new alerts; never overwrite historical
  traces.
