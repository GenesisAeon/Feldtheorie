# Metaquest Campaign Shadow Guard

> R tracks unresolved Metaquest blockers, Θ requires a published parity brief and
> completed BreakPoint ritual before announcements, β≈5.0 accelerates alerts, and
> ζ(R) swells when endorsements grow stale.

## Alerts

1. **mq-sci-shadow-001 — Parity brief absent**
   - *Signal*: Status matrix or codex lacks Metaquest parity reference for a sprint.
   - *Fallout*: Narrative loses parity; endorsements hesitate.
   - *Remedy*: Draft the parity brief, link across system + shadow sigils, hold public
     messaging until Θ is restored.

2. **mq-sci-shadow-002 — Storyboard drift**
   - *Signal*: Simulator presets and manuscript figures diverge; outreach files missing
     demo references.
   - *Fallout*: Promises cannot be reproduced; credibility drops.
   - *Remedy*: Synchronise storyboard, cite ΔAIC context, update codex and ritual notes.

3. **mq-sci-shadow-003 — Governance stale**
   - *Signal*: Endorsement ledger older than 14 days; ethics commitments unsynced.
   - *Fallout*: Governance out of tune; release blocked.
   - *Remedy*: Refresh endorsement file, confirm ethics cross-links, notify governance team.

## Playbooks

- Parity alert → freeze messaging, publish brief, log codex entry with cross-links.
- Storyboard alert → align simulator + manuscript, run ΔAIC checks, document recovery.
- Governance alert → update ledgers, notify stewards, archive timeline in codex.

Shadow whispers keep the Metaquest tide honest; listen before the resonance breaks.
