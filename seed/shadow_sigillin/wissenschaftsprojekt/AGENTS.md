# Wissenschaftsprojekt Shadow Protocol

- Document campaign or manuscript derailments: validation gaps, endorsement delays,
  ethical alarms.
- Define the warning logistic quartet: $R$ = unresolved blockers, $\Theta$ = tolerable
  backlog, $\beta$ = escalation sharpness when blockers cluster, $\zeta(R)$ = damping via
  governance rituals.
- Provide recovery playbooks referencing `seed/BreakPointAnalyse/`, `docs/utac_status_alignment_v1.2.md`,
  and communication assets.
- Maintain tri-layer clarity so both agents and humans can triage quickly.
