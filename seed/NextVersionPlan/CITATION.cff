abstract: >
  We show that the logistic steepness parameter β in Universal Threshold
  Activation-Coupling (UTAC) systems is not a mere fit constant but emerges
  from the coupling-to-noise ratio J/T. Phase 2 provides a microscopic derivation
  via agent-based models, validation across seeds/noise models/lattice sizes,
  and a standardized, fully reproducible pipeline (CI/Docker/Make). Please cite
  this software/research package when reusing code or results.
