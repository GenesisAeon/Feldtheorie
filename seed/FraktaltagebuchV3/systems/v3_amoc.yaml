# ==================== Empirical Thread ====================
empirical:
  observations:
    - AMOC strength weakened from 17 Sv (2004) to 13.25 Sv (2024)
    - FovS indicator crossed zero (negative → positive) = TIPPING SIGNAL
    - 12 FovS zero-crossings detected (flickering)
    - AR(1) autocorrelation increased 13.3% despite variance decline
    - Weakening rate: -0.145 Sv/year (accelerating)

  trends:
    strength: "Linear decline -0.145 Sv/year"
    fovs: "Crossed zero from below (BISTABLE TIPPING!)"
    ews_variance: "Decreasing (τ=-0.254, p<0.0001) - system rigidity"
    ews_ar1: "Increasing (τ=0.730, p<0.0001) - recovery time lengthening"

  model_fit:
    logistic_vs_linear: "STRONG preference for logistic (ΔAIC=+25.2!)"
    goodness_of_fit: "Good (R²=0.634)"
    note: "Highest ΔAIC of all 3 systems - clear nonlinearity"

  bistable_dynamics:
    current_state: "TIPPED (FovS positive)"
    interpretation: |
      Variance ↓ + AR(1) ↑ = classic bistable signature.
      System becoming rigid (variance ↓) but slower to recover (AR(1) ↑).
      FovS crossing zero = transition from stable to unstable basin.

  cascade_connections:
    from_wais: "Meltwater input from WAIS (coupling=0.75)"
    to_wais: "Collapse → regional cooling affects ice (coupling=0.60)"
    to_coral: "Circulation/SST changes affect Atlantic coral (coupling=0.70)"

# ==================== Poetic Thread ====================
poetic:
  narrative: |
    The current has turned. FovS crosses zero.
    The Atlantic forgets how to flow. Europe will freeze.

    17 Sverdrups in 2004. 13.25 Sverdrups now.
    The great conveyor weakens - 0.145 Sv/year, accelerating.
    Each gigaton of Greenland meltwater is a brake on the current.
    The freshwater caps the North Atlantic like oil on water.

    FovS = +0.390. Positive. The Freshwater overshoot Stability indicator
    has crossed zero. Negative meant stable. Positive means TIPPED.
    The system has jumped basins. The conveyor stalls.

    The Cold Blob spreads: -0.629°C SST anomaly.
    A patch of cooling in a warming ocean.
    This is the signature of AMOC collapse - the ocean's
    circulatory system failing. Europe loses its Gulf Stream blanket.

    AR(1) = 0.650, rising (+7.7%, τ=0.730, p<0.0001).
    Recovery time lengthens. The system remembers longer,
    responds slower. This is critical slowing in a bistable system.

    But variance falls (-3.9%, τ=-0.254, p<0.0001).
    The system becomes rigid, locked. Variance ↓ + AR(1) ↑
    is the bistable signature. Not chaos - rigidity before collapse.

    Coherence is low (C=0.151). The signals contradict.
    But emergence is clear (E=0.397). ΔAIC = +25.2 - the STRONGEST
    logistic preference of all three systems. The nonlinearity is undeniable.

    Resonance (R=0.471): moderate. AMOC couples to WAIS (0.60) and Coral (0.70).
    If the conveyor stops, the Atlantic ecosystem collapses.
    If WAIS melts faster, the conveyor slows more. Cascade.

    The narrative is clear (P=0.561). The current has turned.
    β=4.65. Θ=1.02°C. We are at 0.96°C. The threshold is crossed.
    FovS confirms it. The Atlantic will not flow the same again.

  status_metaphor: "The great conveyor forgets its rhythm"
  urgency: CRITICAL
  legibility: HIGH
