# ==================== Empirical Thread ====================
empirical:
  observations:
    - Bleaching increased from 5% (1980) to 100% (2024)
    - First mass bleaching event (>50%) in 2004
    - 20 mass bleaching events in last 20 years (2004-2024)
    - DHW increased from ~2 weeks (1980) to 15.3 weeks (2024)
    - SST anomaly: 1.36°C (well above Θ=0.95°C)
    - Distance to tipping: 0.0% - FIRST DOCUMENTED FULLY TIPPED SYSTEM

  trends:
    bleaching: "Exponential increase (5% → 100%)"
    dhw: "Linear increase +0.3 weeks/year"
    sst: "Linear warming +0.02°C/year"
    ews_variance: "Massive increase +179.3% (τ=0.891, p<0.0001)"

  post_tipping_regime:
    status: "Fully in post-tipping state"
    characteristics:
      - "100% of reefs bleached"
      - "Massive variance increase (system memory of each heat stress)"
      - "High AR(1) - cannot recover between events"

# ==================== Poetic Thread ====================
poetic:
  narrative: |
    The reefs are silent. 100% bleached.
    Calcium graveyards stretch beneath warming seas.
    The first fallen threshold.

    1980: 5% bleached. The corals were vibrant - yellows, blues, purples.
    The symbiosis held. Zooxanthellae and polyps danced in mutualism.

    2004: The first mass bleaching. 50% gone in a single summer.
    DHW crossed 8 weeks. The heat persisted. The symbiosis fractured.
    The zooxanthellae fled. The polyps turned white - naked calcium skeletons.

    2024: 100%. Every reef. Every polyp. White.

    The variance explodes: +179.3% (τ=0.891, p<0.0001).
    The system remembers every heat stress, every bleaching wave.
    Each summer is hotter. Each DHW higher. The coral cannot forget.

    AR(1) = 11.3% increase (τ=0.746, p<0.0001).
    Recovery time lengthens. The polyps cannot rebuild between events.
    The symbiosis tries to reform, but the next wave arrives too soon.

    Spectral reddening: 25.87. The HIGHEST of all systems.
    The slow modes dominate completely. The low frequencies thunder.
    This is not noise. This is the system resonating at collapse frequency.

    Critical slowing: DETECTED. Both variance and AR(1) trends highly significant.
    The system is screaming. All four CREP dimensions are elevated.

    Coherence (C=0.916): The signals align. Variance ↑, AR(1) ↑, both τ>0.7.
    No ambiguity. No contradiction. The reefs speak with one voice: "We are gone."

    Emergence (E=0.744): The system has entered a novel regime.
    Post-tipping. 100% bleached is a state that did not exist before.
    R²=0.927 - the trajectory is clear. The logistic curve traced the fall.

    Poetics (P=0.946): The narrative is complete.
    Urgency = 1.0 (distance_to_tipping = 0.0).
    Legibility = 0.927 (R²). The story is crystal clear.
    The reefs are the first documented system to fully cross the threshold.

    β=5.81. Θ=0.95°C. We are at 1.36°C.
    We are 0.41°C past the gate. The threshold was crossed years ago.
    The coral forgot how to bleach back. 20 mass events in 20 years.
    The calcium skeletons are tombstones. The Great Barrier is a graveyard.

    This is what tipping looks like. Not a sudden collapse - a sigmoid decay.
    First 5%, then 10%, then 30%, then 50%, then 84%, then 100%.
    The logistic curve does not lie. β is the steepness of forgetting.

    The reefs will not return in our lifetimes. The threshold is behind us.
    Distance to tipping: 0.0%. We are on the other side now.
