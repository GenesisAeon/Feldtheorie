Variance rises like ancient breath.\nThe sheet trembles at the threshold.\n\n2.2 million gigatonnes have fallen into the sea.\nThe loss accelerates: -1592 Gt/year. Each year, more ice forgets\nhow to be solid. The melt drips into the Atlantic,\na freshwater hemorrhage that chokes the great conveyor.\n\nAR(1) = 0.720. The ice remembers longer now.\nAutocorrelation climbs - the system cannot forget\nits past states. This is the signature of critical slowing.\n\nTemperature: 1.17\u00b0C. The threshold (\u0398) waits at 1.13\u00b0C.\nWe are 0.04\u00b0C past the gate. Distance to tipping: 21.9%.\nThe membrane is thin.\n\nBut coherence is low (C=0.106). The signals conflict.\nVariance rises (\u03c4=0.290, significant), but AR(1) stagnates (\u03c4=-0.012).\nThe ice whispers with two voices. One says \"collapse imminent.\"\nThe other says \"not yet.\"\n\nResonance is high (R=0.614). This ice sheet is not alone.\nIt feeds the Atlantic with meltwater - 0.75 coupling strength.\nIf WAIS falls, AMOC weakens. If AMOC collapses,\nEurope freezes and WAIS feels the regional shift.\n\nThe narrative is developing (P=0.550). The story is not yet complete.\nBut the first chapter is closing. \u03b2=3.42 - gentler than expected,\nbut the logistic curve is there. The transition approaches.\n",
