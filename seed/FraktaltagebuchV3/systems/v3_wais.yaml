# ==================== Empirical Thread ====================
empirical:
  observations:
    - Mass loss accelerating from -100 Gt/year (2002) to -1592.5 Gt/year (2024)
    - AR(1) autocorrelation increased 33.6% (0.48 → 0.72)
    - Variance increased 69.3% between early and late periods
    - Temperature anomaly currently 1.17°C (approaching Θ = 1.13°C threshold)
    - Distance to tipping: 21.9% (CLOSE!)

  trends:
    mass_balance: "Accelerating loss (quadratic trend)"
    temperature: "Linear warming +0.02°C/year"
    ews_variance: "Increasing (τ=0.290, p<0.0001)"
    ews_ar1: "Stable/slightly declining (τ=-0.012, n.s.)"

  model_fit:
    logistic_vs_linear: "Weak preference for logistic (ΔAIC=1.8)"
    goodness_of_fit: "Moderate (R²=0.425)"
    note: "Mock data → lower β than expected (13.5)"

  cascade_connections:
    to_amoc: "Meltwater flux → AMOC weakening (coupling=0.75)"

# ==================== Poetic Thread ====================
poetic:
  narrative: |
    The ice remembers. Variance rises like ancient breath.
    The sheet trembles at the threshold.

    2.2 million gigatonnes have fallen into the sea.
    The loss accelerates: -1592 Gt/year. Each year, more ice forgets
    how to be solid. The melt drips into the Atlantic,
    a freshwater hemorrhage that chokes the great conveyor.

    AR(1) = 0.720. The ice remembers longer now.
    Autocorrelation climbs - the system cannot forget
    its past states. This is the signature of critical slowing.

    Temperature: 1.17°C. The threshold (Θ) waits at 1.13°C.
    We are 0.04°C past the gate. Distance to tipping: 21.9%.
    The membrane is thin.

    But coherence is low (C=0.106). The signals conflict.
    Variance rises (τ=0.290, significant), but AR(1) stagnates (τ=-0.012).
    The ice whispers with two voices. One says "collapse imminent."
    The other says "not yet."

    Resonance is high (R=0.614). This ice sheet is not alone.
    It feeds the Atlantic with meltwater - 0.75 coupling strength.
    If WAIS falls, AMOC weakens. If AMOC collapses,
    Europe freezes and WAIS feels the regional shift.

    The narrative is developing (P=0.550). The story is not yet complete.
    But the first chapter is closing. β=3.42 - gentler than expected,
    but the logistic curve is there. The transition approaches.

  status_metaphor: "The giant sleeps restlessly, turning in its bed"
  urgency: HIGH
  legibility: MODERATE
