Positive. The Freshwater overshoot Stability indicator\nhas crossed zero. Negative meant stable. Positive means TIPPED.\nThe system has jumped basins. The conveyor stalls.\n\nThe Cold Blob spreads: -0.629\u00b0C SST anomaly.\nA patch of cooling in a warming ocean.\nThis is the signature of AMOC collapse - the ocean's\ncirculatory system failing. Europe loses its Gulf Stream blanket.\n\nAR(1) = 0.650, rising (+7.7%, \u03c4=0.730, p<0.0001).\nRecovery time lengthens. The system remembers longer,\nresponds slower. This is critical slowing in a bistable system.\n\nBut variance falls (-3.9%, \u03c4=-0.254, p<0.0001).\nThe system becomes rigid, locked. Variance \u2193 + AR(1) \u2191\nis the bistable signature. Not chaos - rigidity before collapse.\n\nCoherence is low (C=0.151). The signals contradict.\nBut emergence is clear (E=0.397). \u0394AIC = +25.2 - the STRONGEST\nlogistic preference of all three systems. The nonlinearity is undeniable.\n\nResonance (R=0.471): moderate. AMOC couples to WAIS (0.60) and Coral (0.70).\nIf the conveyor stops, the Atlantic ecosystem collapses.\nIf WAIS melts faster, the conveyor slows more. Cascade.\n\nThe narrative is clear (P=0.561). The current has turned.\n\u03b2=4.65. \u0398=1.02\u00b0C. We are at 0.96\u00b0C. The threshold is crossed.\nFovS confirms it. The Atlantic will not flow the same again.\n",
