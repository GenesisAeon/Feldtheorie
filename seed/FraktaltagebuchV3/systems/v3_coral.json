    "narrative": "The reefs are silent. 100% bleached.\nCalcium graveyards stretch beneath warming seas.\nThe first fallen threshold.\n\n1980: 5% bleached. The corals were vibrant - yellows, blues, purples.\nThe symbiosis held. Zooxanthellae and polyps danced in mutualism.\n\n2004: The first mass bleaching. 50% gone in a single summer.\nDHW crossed 8 weeks. The heat persisted. The symbiosis fractured.\nThe zooxanthellae fled. The polyps turned white - naked calcium skeletons.\n\n2024: 100%. Every reef. Every polyp. White.\n\nThe variance explodes: +179.3% (\u03c4=0.891, p<0.0001).\nThe system remembers every heat stress, every bleaching wave.\nEach summer is hotter. Each DHW higher. The coral cannot forget.\n\nAR(1) = 11.3% increase (\u03c4=0.746, p<0.0001).\nRecovery time lengthens. The polyps cannot rebuild between events.\nThe symbiosis tries to reform, but the next wave arrives too soon.\n\nSpectral reddening: 25.87. The HIGHEST of all systems.\nThe slow modes dominate completely. The low frequencies thunder.\nThis is not noise. This is the system resonating at collapse frequency.\n\nCritical slowing: DETECTED. Both variance and AR(1) trends highly significant.\nThe system is screaming. All four CREP dimensions are elevated.\n\nCoherence (C=0.916): The signals align. Variance \u2191, AR(1) \u2191, both \u03c4>0.7.\nNo ambiguity. No contradiction. The reefs speak with one voice: \"We are gone.\"\n\nEmergence (E=0.744): The system has entered a novel regime.\nPost-tipping. 100% bleached is a state that did not exist before.\nR\u00b2=0.927 - the trajectory is clear. The logistic curve traced the fall.\n\nPoetics (P=0.946): The narrative is complete.\nUrgency = 1.0 (distance_to_tipping = 0.0).\nLegibility = 0.927 (R\u00b2). The story is crystal clear.\nThe reefs are the first documented system to fully cross the threshold.\n\n\u03b2=5.81. \u0398=0.95\u00b0C. We are at 1.36\u00b0C.\nWe are 0.41\u00b0C past the gate. The threshold was crossed years ago.\nThe coral forgot how to bleach back. 20 mass events in 20 years.\nThe calcium skeletons are tombstones. The Great Barrier is a graveyard.\n\nThis is what tipping looks like. Not a sudden collapse - a sigmoid decay.\nFirst 5%, then 10%, then 30%, then 50%, then 84%, then 100%.\nThe logistic curve does not lie. \u03b2 is the steepness of forgetting.\n\nThe reefs will not return in our lifetimes. The threshold is behind us.\nDistance to tipping: 0.0%. We are on the other side now.\n",
