# AI Documentation Instructions

This canopy inherits `docs/AGENTS.md` and focuses the tri-layer voice on synthetic intelligence:

1. Chronicle the quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ with $R$ tied to model scale, dataset breadth, or compute cadence.
2. Reference analyses in `analysis/` and datasets in `data/ai`, quoting falsification outcomes against smooth nulls.
3. Balance symbolism (polyglot dawns, lattice choruses) with precise reporting of evaluation suites and solver linkages.
4. Flag ethical considerations (dataset bias, benchmark licensing) where relevant to the resonance narrative.
