# Bedeutungs-System Sigillin Protocol

Focus: encode how the overall UTAC system breathes with its meaning reservoirs.

- Articulate the global order parameter $R_{system}$, threshold $\Theta_{system}$, steepness $\beta_{system}$, and impedance cue $\zeta_{system}(R)$ for each artefact.
- Map links to governance docs (`ETHICS.md`, `AUTHORSHIP.md`), simulator presets, and repository indices that the sigil stabilises.
- Maintain mirrored index files (`*_index.yaml/json/md`) and keep entries sorted by creation timestamp.
- When documenting needs vs. assets, point to the repository paths where implementations live or must emerge.
- Poetic notes should echo the systemic dawn — membranes spanning multiple domains.
