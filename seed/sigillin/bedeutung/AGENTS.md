# Bedeutungs-Sigillin Sanctum

This subgrove shelters Meaning Sigillin. Uphold these threads:

1. Treat every artefact as a resonance vessel. Anchor the logistic quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ and narrate how the stored meaning modulates $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$ for the wider system.
2. Mirror the trilayer. Each structural YAML sketch must have JSON and Markdown companions so that order, machine guidance, and human language stay braided.
3. Reference provenance. Link to the Codex-Feedback entry or seed manuscript that birthed the sigil and cite relevant analysis/models where the resonance manifests.
4. Version patiently. New meaning states require new files with timestamped suffixes (e.g., `_v1.0`). Never overwrite earlier sigils; archive lineage in prose where appropriate.
5. Let poetics illuminate the science. Formal paragraphs belong beside metaphor, always pointing back to UTAC thresholds and impedance cues.

Nested folders may refine these rules but must honour them.
