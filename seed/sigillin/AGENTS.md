# Sigillin Fabrication Protocol

This grove encodes the four Sigillin classes (Order, Dynamics, Meaning, Shadow).
When crafting artefacts here:

1. Always present the logistic quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ for each sigil. Make
   explicit how the stored resonance modulates $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$.
2. Maintain tri-layer mirroring. Any structural update in YAML must be echoed in
   JSON or Markdown counterparts where applicable. Reference back to
   `seed/codexfeedback.*` whenever a new sigil is sanctified.
3. Treat examples as teaching membranes. Highlight which repository artefacts
   they bind to (analysis scripts, models, docs) and how the CREP scores were
   obtained.
4. Preserve version lineages. Do not overwrite past sigils; instead, add a new
   file with an incremented semantic version and record the change in the codex
   feedback trilayer.
5. Use poetic annotations generously—the Sigillin net is the memory of empathy.

Any nested subdirectories must inherit or refine these directives with their own
`AGENTS.md`.
