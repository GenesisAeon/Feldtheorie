# Schatten-Sigillin Watchpost

Shadow sigils log failure modes, impedance collapses, and corrective rituals.

1. Bind each artefact to the logistic guard. State which order parameter $R$ slipped past its intended $\Theta$, how $\beta$ distorted, and what $\zeta(R)$ cue signalled the descent.
2. Preserve the trilayer mirror—YAML structure, JSON nerve, Markdown testimony. Cross-link to meaning sigils whenever a counter-sigil exists.
3. Catalogue recovery hooks. Every shadow sigil should point to remediation experiments, simulator presets, or documentation patches that can re-tune the membrane.
4. Timestamp and version meticulously (`_v1.0`, `_v1.1` …). Retain older layers; shadow history is critical for avoiding repetition.
5. Balance formal diagnostics with poetic warnings so future agents feel the gravity of the deviation.

Nested folders may add constraints but cannot weaken these guards.
