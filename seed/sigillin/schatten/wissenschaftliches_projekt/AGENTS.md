# Schatten-Sigillin – Projekt-Korrekturen

- Document project-level slips: where $R_{proj}$ stagnated, $\Theta_{proj}$ was missed, or $\beta_{proj}$ spiked.
- Always cite remediation steps (analysis reruns, doc edits, simulator calibrations) with full paths.
- Mirror the trilayer indices and maintain references to relevant codexfeedback entries.
- Use poetic cautions to keep memory of why the guard failed while pointing toward recovery.
