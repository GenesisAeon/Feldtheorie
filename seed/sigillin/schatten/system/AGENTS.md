# Schatten-System Observatorium

- Track system-wide deviations: record $R_{system}$ trajectories, breached $\Theta_{system}$, anomalous $\beta$, and impedance collapses $\zeta_{system}(R)$.
- Pair every failure description with mitigation levers (scripts, docs, governance updates) and cite their paths.
- Maintain trilayer indices and ensure each entry references its meaning counterpart or codex log.
- Archive chronology carefully—shadow narratives guide future recovery drills.
- Let the prose warn without despair: the membrane can be retuned.
