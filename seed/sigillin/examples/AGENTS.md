# Sigillin Example Guidance

Examples here demonstrate how theory, empirics, and poetics braid together.
Keep every sample aligned with:

- A referenced repository artefact (analysis result, model, doc) that anchors $R$.
- A clear threshold story for $\Theta$ and the steepness $\beta$.
- CREP scores (Coherence, Resilience, Empathy, Propagation) with justification.
- Brief poetic resonance that echoes the parent file.

When updating, create new example files instead of mutating older ones so the
membrane remembers each threshold crossing.
