    formal: |
      Logistic envelopes fitted per sweep confirm β within [3.8, 5.6], null comparison
      against exponential surfaces yields ΔAIC median 18. Safety delay ζ(R) toggles for
      overdamped regimes ensure σ(β(R-Θ)) stays smooth.
    empirical: |
      Sweep logs stored under `simulation/results/2025-10-31/` with 256 runs.
      Confidence intervals exported in `analysis/results/threshold_sandbox_overview.json`.
    poetic: |
      The sandbox is a tidepool: each parameter moon pulls the membrane tighter until
      a crest of resonance breaks across the field.
