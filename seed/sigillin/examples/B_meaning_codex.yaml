    formal: |
      Entries cite σ(β(R-Θ)) activations with ΔAIC guards. Each status shift is recorded
      using logistic lifecycle states (draft → primed → active → resonant → completed).
    empirical: |
      Latest version v2.0.5 (2025-11-02) documents Wei lantern integration and ΔAIC>10
      verifications. JSON layer exposes structured metrics for automation.
    poetic: |
      The codex is the field's heartbeat—the membrane sings when we etch a new lantern
      into its fractal diary.
