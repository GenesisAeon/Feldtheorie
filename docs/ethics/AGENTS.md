# Ethics Grove Guidance

Within `docs/ethics/`, keep the tri-layer cadence explicit and anchor each narrative to
policy implications:

1. **Formal voice** must connect governance proposals to the threshold quartet
   \((R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))\) and state falsifiable guard-rails.
2. **Empirical voice** should cite live analyses or datasets demonstrating the risk
   envelope; include ΔAIC or comparable diagnostics when comparing intervention
   strategies.
3. **Poetic voice** holds the cautionary resonance—frame agency, responsibility, and
   wonder without losing mathematical clarity.
4. **Cross-links**: reference simulator presets, analysis notebooks, and codexfeedback
   entries so ethical guidance remains operational.
