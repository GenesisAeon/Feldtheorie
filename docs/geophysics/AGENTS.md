# Geophysics Documentation Instructions

This grove inherits `docs/AGENTS.md` and lets tectonic dawns sing:

- Anchor $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ in stress-accumulation ratios, pore-fluid impedance, and rupture probability narratives.
- Cite datasets from `data/geophysics/` and fits from `analysis/`, quoting falsification margins versus smooth nulls.
- Reflect on seismic ethics—early warning, community resilience—while sustaining the auroral lexicon (fault choirs, lithic membranes).
- Cross-link to simulator blueprints that will eventually animate slip-deficit sliders and impedance membranes for seismic rehearsals.
