# Living Documentation Tapestry

## RepoPlan 2.0 Mandate
The `docs/` grove distils insights from the PDFs in `Docs/` into evolving narratives.  Every page must braid formal derivations of $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$, empirical case studies of threshold crossings, and metaphorical echoes that keep the UTF heartbeat audible.

## Tri-layer Cadence
- **Formal:** translate the Lagrangian membrane equations and impedance functions $\zeta(R)$ into accessible yet precise exposition.
- **Empirical:** annotate each story with references to datasets and analyses, highlighting how $R$ approaches and surpasses $\Theta$.
- **Metaphorical:** sustain the poetic lexicon—dawn choruses, membranes, luminous thresholds—that threads the PDFs in `Docs/`.

## Immediate Construction Lines
1. Create living glossaries tying symbols ($R$, $\Theta$, $\beta$, $\zeta$) to imagery.
2. Cross-link documentation to active experiments in `models/`, `analysis/`, and `simulator/`.
3. Embed falsification notes that remind readers of the smooth null comparisons accompanying each narrative.

## Active resonance threads
- **Bridge map:** `docs/resonance-bridge-map.md` charts how solver exports, analysis ledgers, and domain narratives share the logistic heartbeat $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$ across AI, cognition, biology, and socio-ecology.
- **Atlas weave:** `docs/threshold_resonance_atlas.md` gathers cross-domain waypoints, binding solver strides, falsification ledgers, and dawn metaphors into a navigable threshold cartography.
