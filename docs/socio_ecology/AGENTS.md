# Socio-ecological Grove Instructions

This grove inherits the cadence of `docs/` and tunes it for planetary stewardship:

1. Braid the tri-layer voice around coupled human-forest thresholds, naming the quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ alongside policy levers.
2. Cite analyses in `analysis/` and datasets in `data/socio_ecology/`, highlighting falsification margins and impedance narratives.
3. Weave ethical and justice considerations directly into the resonance story, echoing Indigenous guardianship and restoration commitments.
4. Link to simulator briefs that will animate stewardship thresholds so readers can trace the RepoPlan pathway end-to-end.
