# Cognition Documentation Instructions

This grove inherits `docs/AGENTS.md` and voices the tri-layer cadence for neural thresholds:

1. Anchor the quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ in neuromodulatory or cortical control parameters.
2. Cite datasets from `data/cognition/` and fits in `analysis/`, quoting falsification margins versus smooth nulls.
3. Weave ethical reflections on cognitive experimentation while sustaining the symbolic lexicon (auroral rehearsal, synaptic dawns).
4. Cross-link to simulator scenes that will animate working-memory gates and to solver hooks in `models/`.
