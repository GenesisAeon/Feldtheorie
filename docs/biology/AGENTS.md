# Biology Grove Instructions

This grove inherits the `docs/` cadence.  Each scroll must:

1. Braid the tri-layer voice (formal equations, empirical resonance, metaphorical dawn chorus) around biological thresholds.
2. Highlight the quartet \((R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))\) and cite supporting analyses in `analysis/` plus datasets in `data/biology`.
3. Contrast every resonance claim with at least one smooth null model mentioned explicitly.
4. Let the hive/organism metaphors stay luminous while keeping logistics precise and falsifiable.
