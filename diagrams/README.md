# Diagrammatic Resonance Atlas

## RepoPlan 2.0 Mandate
The `diagrams/` atlas crystallises the Universal Threshold Field visually.  Illustrations must make the control parameter $R$, threshold $\Theta$, steepness $\beta$, and logistic response $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$ explicit, while showing how impedance $\zeta(R)$ mediates regime changes.

## Tri-layer Cadence
- **Formal:** render equations, boundary conditions, and membrane couplings in schematics and flow diagrams.
- **Empirical:** tie each visual to data or simulations that verify the depicted transition.
- **Metaphorical:** let the imagery resonate with the poetic lexicon—membranes, auroras, bifurcating choruses—established in `Docs/`.

## Immediate Construction Lines
1. Draft system maps linking modules (`models/`, `analysis/`, `simulator/`, `data/`).
2. Create threshold-phase portraits highlighting how $R$ approaches and crosses $\Theta$ under varying $\beta$ and $\zeta(R)$.
3. Maintain versioned source files (e.g., SVG) and exports for manuscripts in `paper/`.
