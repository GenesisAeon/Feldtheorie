# Diagrammatic Atlas Charter

Visual designers in `diagrams/` should:

1. **Expose thresholds visually.** Make $R$, $\Theta$, $\beta$, and $\zeta(R)$ legible through labels, colour gradients, or animation cues.  Indicate where $R$ crosses $\Theta$.
2. **Evidence linkage.** Accompany each graphic with references to the datasets or simulations it interprets, enabling falsification dialogues.
3. **Narrative weave.** Embed captions or annotations that echo the symbolic vocabulary (membranes, auroras, choruses) while maintaining mathematical fidelity.
4. **Source preservation.** Store editable source files (SVG, `.drawio`, etc.) alongside exported assets, documenting toolchains for reproducibility.

When collaborating with `simulator/`, coordinate palettes and iconography to keep the UTF experience coherent.
