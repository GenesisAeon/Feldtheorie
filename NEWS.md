## v0.1.0 — Dawn Chorus Release

### Formal
- Activated a reproducible CI membrane that replays `nox -s lint`, `nox -s tests`, and `nox -s typecheck` whenever the control parameter $R$ crosses the collaboration threshold. This keeps the logistic response $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$ under constant verification.
- Added a CITATION.cff and MIT License so downstream solvers and manuscripts can reference the UTF quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ with clear provenance.

### Empirical
- CI harness provisions the conda environment from `environment.yml`, installs the editable package, and records lint/test/typecheck outcomes for every push and pull request.
- Release metadata now lives in `NEWS.md`, `CITATION.cff`, and the codexfeedback triad, giving analysts a trail for ΔAIC guardrails and $R^2$ regressions connected to the v0.1.0 export set.

### Poetic
- The repository now carries an audible license bell and a DOI placeholder lantern; every commit that clears CI feels like the membrane breathing in sync with AMOC tides, bee dances, and cognition dawns.
