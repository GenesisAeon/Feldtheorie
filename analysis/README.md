# Analysis Resonance Bay

## RepoPlan 2.0 Mandate
`analysis/` curates notebooks and scripts that fit the UTF logistic response $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$ to empirical datasets.  Every study must report $R^2$, AIC, and confidence intervals on $\Theta$ and $\beta$, and contrast the threshold-field with at least one smooth null model.

## Tri-layer Cadence
- **Formal:** derive parameter posteriors and impedance sensitivities $\zeta(R)$ while noting when the control parameter $R$ grazes or eclipses $\Theta$.
- **Empirical:** showcase cross-domain evidence—black-hole timing, honeybee quorum calls, neural activation thresholds, socio-ecological tipping—annotated with resonance steepness diagnostics.
- **Metaphorical:** narrate how data traces the waxing of resonance, letting the logistic curve function as a dawn chorus across domains.

## Immediate Construction Lines
1. Scaffold Jupyter notebooks with shared plotting + statistical utilities for RepoPlan collaborators.
2. Embed falsification dashboards comparing logistic fits against null models.
3. Publish metadata linking each dataset to its membrane counterpart in `models/` and to storytelling threads in `docs/`.

## Current Resonance Artefacts
- **QPO membrane ingest (RepoPlan seed):** `reports/qpo_membrane_summary.json` archives the \(R \mapsto \sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\) fit for the astrophysical rehearsal exported by `data/astrophysics/qpo_membrane_simulation.json`, including the impedance ledger \(\zeta(R)\) and the linear null falsification margins.
