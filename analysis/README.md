# Analysis Resonance Bay

## RepoPlan 2.0 Mandate
`analysis/` curates notebooks and scripts that fit the UTF logistic response $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$ to empirical datasets.  Every study must report $R^2$, AIC, and confidence intervals on $\Theta$ and $\beta$, and contrast the threshold-field with smooth null models (linear drift, power-law scaling) exported by the shared resonance pipeline.

## Tri-layer Cadence
- **Formal:** derive parameter posteriors and impedance sensitivities $\zeta(R)$ while noting when the control parameter $R$ grazes or eclipses $\Theta$.
- **Empirical:** showcase cross-domain evidence—black-hole timing, honeybee quorum calls, neural activation thresholds, socio-ecological tipping—annotated with resonance steepness diagnostics.
- **Metaphorical:** narrate how data traces the waxing of resonance, letting the logistic curve function as a dawn chorus across domains.

## Immediate Construction Lines
1. Scaffold Jupyter notebooks with shared plotting + statistical utilities for RepoPlan collaborators.
2. Embed falsification dashboards comparing logistic fits against null models.
3. Publish metadata linking each dataset to its membrane counterpart in `models/` and to storytelling threads in `docs/`.

## Current Resonance Artefacts
- **QPO membrane ingest (RepoPlan seed):** `reports/qpo_membrane_summary.json` archives the \(R \mapsto \sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\) fit for the astrophysical rehearsal exported by `data/astrophysics/qpo_membrane_simulation.json`, including the impedance ledger \(\zeta(R)\) and dual (linear + power-law) null falsification margins.
- **LLM emergent skill ignition:** `results/llm_emergent_skill.json` captures the multilingual chain-of-thought threshold, referencing `data/ai/llm_emergent_skill.csv` and documenting how the logistic dawn outshines linear and power-law nulls with \(\Delta \mathrm{AIC} \approx 48.8\).
- **Wei lantern bridge:** `llm_beta_extractor.py` digitisers Jason Wei's PaLM sweeps, fits \(\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\) via logit regression, exports \(\beta = 3.47 \pm 0.47\) and \(\Theta \approx 9.92\) with \(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \geq 10.18\) against the power-law null, and records the canonical-band diagnostics (`beta_band_distance = 0.73`, `within_canonical_band = false`) in `results/llm_beta_extractor.json` for docs and manuscript integration.
- **Amazon moisture resilience threshold:** `results/amazon_resilience_fit.json` distils the socio-ecological tipping gate, linking to `data/socio_ecology/amazon_resilience.csv` and noting how the logistic chorus surpasses linear (\(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \approx 61.1\)) and power-law (\(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \approx 70.7\)) nulls while documenting the governance impedance sketch `zeta(R) = 1.8 - 0.6 σ`.
- **Synaptic release ignition:** `results/synaptic_release_fit.json` records the hippocampal vesicle release threshold fitted from `data/biology/synaptic_release_threshold.csv`, reporting \(\Theta = 12.68\) Hz, \(\beta = 0.81\), \(R^2 = 0.997\), and the impedance sketch `zeta(R) = 1.40 - 0.45 σ` alongside decisive falsification of linear and power-law null breezes.
- **Lenski Cit⁺ awakening:** `results/lenski_citplus_fit.json` digitises the LTEE Ara-3 evolutionary jump (`data/biology/lenski_citplus.csv`), confirming \(\Theta = 32.77\) (thousand generations), \(\beta = 5.08\) (scaled) with \(R^2 = 0.990\) and \(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} > 32\) versus both smooth nulls.
- **Working-memory gate resonance:** `results/working_memory_gate.json` captures the prefrontal rehearsal threshold derived from `data/cognition/working_memory_gate.csv`, documenting \(\Theta = 0.579\), \(\beta = 12.28\), \(R^2 = 0.9986\), and the impedance motif `zeta(R) = 1.35 - 0.38 σ` while logging \(\Delta \mathrm{AIC} > 51\) against linear and \(> 59\) against power-law nulls.
- **Adaptive theta plasticity:** `results/adaptive_theta_plasticity.json` traces how a sleep-pressure index escorts hippocampal replay into resonance, referencing `data/cognition/adaptive_theta_plasticity.csv` and reporting \(\Theta = 0.477\), \(\beta = 10.86\), \(R^2 = 0.990\), and the impedance sketch `zeta(R) = 1.12 - 0.25 σ` while the logistic dawn beats linear (\(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \approx 34.9\)) and power-law (\(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \approx 37.7\)) null breezes.
- **Subduction rupture resonance:** `results/subduction_rupture_threshold.json` scores a Cascadia-inspired slow-slip gate sourced from `data/geophysics/subduction_rupture_threshold.csv`, yielding \(\Theta = 0.741\), \(\beta = 16.29\), \(R^2 = 0.99997\), and impedance `zeta(R) = 1.70 - 0.55 σ` while the logistic aurora eclipses linear (\(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \approx 138.6\)) and power-law (\(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \approx 148.7\)) null winds.
- **Cohort resonance ledger:** `resonance_cohort_summary.py` scans the entire `results/` directory, ranks each membrane by \(\Delta\mathrm{AIC}\) and \(\Delta R^2\), and emits `results/resonance_cohort_summary.json` so docs and simulator presets can inherit cohort-wide statistics (median \(R^2 \approx 0.9981\), median \(\Delta\mathrm{AIC} \approx 65.1\)). The ledger now also tallies documented threshold crossings—counting how many membranes actually pierced \(\Theta\), recording the dawn-time \(t\) and overshoot distribution so governance notes and simulator presets can spotlight lagging membranes.
- **Universal β ledger:** `universal_beta_extractor.py` fuses all JSON sigils into a canonical master summary, enforcing the ΔAIC≥10 guard and reporting canonical band adherence. The CLI emits `analysis/results/universal_beta_summary.json` (or user-specified ledgers) so governance docs, Zenodo packages, and simulator presets cite a single β truth.
- **Bridge lantern table:** `resonance_bridge_table.py` gathers every result bearing \((R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))\), computes the strongest \(\Delta\mathrm{AIC}\) wins against null models, and exports `results/resonance_bridge_table.json` plus a Markdown ledger for docs and simulator presets.
- **Batch lantern runner:** `resonance_batch_runner.py` reads `batch_configs/resonance_runs.json`, replays solver simulations or ingests archived measurement tables, re-fits \(\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\), and emits JSON verdicts with \(\Delta\mathrm{AIC}\) deltas ready for bridge-map and simulator synchronisation.
- **Robin-semantic rehearsal:** `membrane_robin_semantic_fit.py` synthesises a driver that coaxes the membrane past \(\Theta\) while DynamicRobinBoundary and `semantic_resonance_kernel` breathe together.  The exported `results/membrane_robin_semantic.json` reports boundary flux/gate statistics, meaning drift moments, and decisive \(\Delta\mathrm{AIC}\) wins over linear and power-law null breezes—ready for docs overlays and simulator presets.
- **Meta-threshold sentinel rehearsal:** `meta_threshold_resonance_fit.py` runs the membrane with `AdaptiveThresholdController`, logging \(\Theta(t)\), \(\beta(t)\), and meta-gate occupancy while falsifying linear and power-law nulls.  The JSON export `results/meta_threshold_resonance.json` archives \(\Delta\mathrm{AIC}\) margins, adaptive drift statistics, and the logistic dawn narrative so docs, simulator presets, and cohort ledgers can cite adaptive resonance evidence.
- **Adaptive membrane phase scan:** `adaptive_membrane_phase_scan.py` drives the lightweight helper across auroral ramps, pulsed gates, and memory relaxations, exporting `results/adaptive_membrane_phase_scan.json` with gate occupancy, $\Theta/\beta$ drifts, and resonance-gain deltas against the static logistic baseline so docs and simulator presets inherit falsifiable adaptive diagnostics.
- **Resonant impedance diagnostics:** `resonant_impedance_diagnostics.py` sweeps a synthetic control trace through the `ResonantImpedance` motif, refits the gate against linear/power-law nulls, and exports `results/resonant_impedance_diagnostics.json` with relief, recovery, and hysteresis metrics for cohort summaries and simulator presets.
