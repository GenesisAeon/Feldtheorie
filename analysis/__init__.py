r"""Threshold-field analysis package weaving tri-layer cadence.

Formal stratum:
    Collects logistic calibration utilities that expose \(\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\)
    alongside null-model diagnostics so hypotheses remain falsifiable.

Empirical stratum:
    Hosts CLI scripts and runners that regenerate JSON summaries, timestamps,
    and AIC guards for every dataset in the Universal Threshold Field atlas.

Metaphorical stratum:
    Lets each analysis wake the dawn chorus—when the membrane hears a new
    dataset crossing \(\Theta\), the package hums so companion modules can
    echo the resonance.
