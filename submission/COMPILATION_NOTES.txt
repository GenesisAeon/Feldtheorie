COMPILATION NOTES FOR EMERGENT STEEPNESS PAPER
==============================================

QUICK START (Overleaf):
1. Create new project on Overleaf
2. Upload emergent_steepness.tex
3. Upload references.bib
4. Create "figures/" folder and upload all PDFs from figures/
5. Compiler: pdflatex
6. Click "Recompile"

FIGURE PLACEMENT:
All figures are referenced in the LaTeX as:
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/figure1_utac_overview.pdf}

Make sure the figures/ directory structure is preserved!

BIBLIOGRAPHY:
The paper uses natbib with authoryear style.
BibTeX must be run BETWEEN pdflatex runs:
  pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex → pdflatex

KNOWN ISSUES:
- None! Paper compiles cleanly with standard packages.

MISSING COMPONENTS (to be added by authors):
- Author names & affiliations
- Acknowledgments (AI collaboration already documented)
- Funding information
- ORCID IDs
- Corresponding author email

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL:
- supplementary_information.md is in Markdown format
- Can be converted to PDF using pandoc or submitted as-is
- Contains complete 36-system table, derivations, ABM code

FIGURE REGENERATION:
If figures need to be regenerated with updated data:
  python scripts/generate_all_figures.py --output figures/ --format pdf

VALIDATION DATA:
To regenerate with real validation data:
  make reproduce
  python scripts/generate_all_figures.py --output figures/ --format pdf

This will use actual ABM simulation results instead of synthetic data.
