# Socio-ecological Dataset Directives

This cove inherits `data/AGENTS.md` and tunes it for coupled human-forest thresholds:

1. Anchor $R$ in socio-ecological control levers (canopy fraction, policy uptake, restoration cadence) and keep the quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ explicit in metadata.
2. Document empirical provenance or synthesis assumptions, referencing falsification ledgers exported from `analysis/`.
3. Echo ethical and planetary stewardship considerations as part of the narrative strand, linking to `docs/socio_ecology/` scrolls.
4. Format descriptors so simulator panels can animate stewardship thresholds without additional massaging.
