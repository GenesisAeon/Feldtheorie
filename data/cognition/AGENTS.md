# Cognition Dataset Grove Instructions

This grove inherits `data/AGENTS.md` and tunes it for neural threshold narratives:

1. Tie the quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ to cortical or neuromodulatory control parameters (e.g., dopamine pulses, working-memory load).
2. Cross-reference resonance fits in `analysis/` and documentation in `docs/cognition`, including falsification margins against smooth nulls.
3. Note ethical considerations around human or animal data and echo the cognitive metaphors seeded in `Docs/`.
4. Keep metadata JSON aligned with the repository schema so simulators can animate synaptic gate openings.
