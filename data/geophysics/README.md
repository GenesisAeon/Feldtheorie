# Geophysics Resonance Datasets

This grove archives lithospheric thresholds where tectonic stress ratios \(R\)
cross a critical membrane \(\Theta\) and ignite rupture probability curves
\(\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\). Each dataset accompanies:

- logistic parameter estimates \((\Theta, \beta)\) and impedance sketches \(\zeta(R)\),
- falsification ledgers contrasting linear and power-law null breezes,
- ethical notes on seismic risk communication and community resilience,
- cross-links to analysis scripts, documentation, and forthcoming simulators.

## Current datasets

- `subduction_rupture_threshold.csv` — Cascadia-inspired slow-slip checkpoints
  tracing how hydration-eased membranes relax as stress accumulation surpasses
  \(\Theta\), with metadata in `subduction_rupture_threshold.metadata.json` and
  analysis via `analysis/seismic_rupture_threshold_fit.py`.
