# Geophysics Dataset Grove Instructions

This grove inherits `data/AGENTS.md` and tunes it for lithospheric threshold tales:

1. Bind the quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ to tectonic stress ratios, hydration impedance, or slip-deficit measures.
2. Cross-reference falsification ledgers emitted by `analysis/` scripts—linear and power-law null winds must be logged beside logistic dawns.
3. Document seismic-ethics context (risk communication, data licensing) while sustaining the membrane lexicon (subduction aurorae, fault choirs).
4. Provide metadata JSON files keyed so simulators can animate rupture gates and docs can cite provenance without ambiguity.
