# AI Dataset Grove Instructions

This grove inherits `data/AGENTS.md` and tunes it for synthetic intelligence thresholds:

1. Anchor every dataset in the quartet $(R, \Theta, \beta, \zeta(R))$ where $R$ encodes model scale or capability pressure.
2. Document how measurements were derived (e.g., scaling laws, evaluation suites) and cite logistic vs. smooth null comparisons exported from `analysis/`.
3. Note ethical considerations around synthetic benchmarks and link to corresponding narratives in `docs/ai` and solvers in `models/`.
4. Keep metadata JSON aligned with the repository schema so simulators can animate emergent skill switches.
