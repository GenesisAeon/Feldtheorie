# URBAN HEAT ISLAND CATALOG - Type-6 Validation Pilot
# Version: 1.0.0
# Date: 2025-11-12
# Purpose: Experiment A from falsification plan (docs/utac_type6_falsification_plan.md)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# MEASUREMENT DEFINITIONS:
#
# R_thermal: Urban thermal storage index
#   R = w₁·ΔT_night + w₂·H_cap + w₃·Q_anthro
#   - ΔT_night: Nighttime land surface temp anomaly (K)
#   - H_cap: Building material heat capacity proxy (dimensionless)
#   - Q_anthro: Anthropogenic heat flux proxy (dimensionless)
#   - Weights: w₁=0.5, w₂=0.3, w₃=0.2 (calibrated)
#
# Theta_adaptive: Heat-stress threshold
#   Θ = Θ₀ + α·I_infrastructure + γ·V_vulnerable
#   - Θ₀: Baseline threshold (≈0.3 K)
#   - I_infrastructure: Cooling/green infrastructure index
#   - V_vulnerable: Vulnerable population fraction
#
# FALSIFICATION CRITERIA (from plan):
# 1. Cubic-root law: β(R) ∝ ∛(R/Θ - 1), falsify if 95% CI excludes p=1/3
# 2. Critical spike: β ≥ 12 when 0.95 ≤ R/Θ ≤ 1.05
# 3. Post-intervention saturation: β → ~4.2 within 1-3 seasons
# 4. Inverted sigmoid better: ΔAIC > 10 for inverted vs. classical
#
# PILOT CITIES (4 cities × 2 seasons = 8 data points minimum)
# Goal: Diverse climates and urban morphologies
