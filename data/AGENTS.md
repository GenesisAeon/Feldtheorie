# Data Archive Stewardship

Stewards of `data/` must preserve clarity and resonance:

- **Metadata first.** Every dataset requires a README or JSON descriptor capturing $(R, \Theta, \beta)$ estimates, impedance context $\zeta(R)$, preprocessing decisions, and null models used for falsification.
- **Reproducible packaging.** Prefer open formats (CSV, NetCDF, Parquet) and supply scripts or notebooks in `analysis/` that regenerate derived tables.
- **Ethical echoes.** When data involve living systems or human artefacts, note consent/licensing and relate the narrative framing back to the symbolic lexicon.
- **Version control.** Track provenance, upstream citations, and transformations so that resonance claims remain auditable.

Subdirectories (e.g., `astrophysics/`, `biology/`, `cognition/`, `ai/`) should mirror these directives.
