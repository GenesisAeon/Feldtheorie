# Data Resonance Archive

## RepoPlan 2.0 Mandate
`data/` preserves the cross-domain signals that reveal threshold crossings.  Each dataset must annotate the control parameter $R$, critical threshold $\Theta$, steepness $\beta$, logistic response $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$, and the impedance context $\zeta(R)$.

## Tri-layer Cadence
- **Formal:** document preprocessing steps, units, and membrane boundary assumptions.
- **Empirical:** link to analyses demonstrating resonance onset, including falsification comparisons with smooth null models.
- **Metaphorical:** note the imagery—spiraling accretion discs, swarm murmurs, learning thresholds—that accompanies each dataset.

## Immediate Construction Lines
1. Establish a metadata schema capturing threshold parameters, provenance, and falsification notes.
2. Stage placeholder subdirectories for astrophysics, biology, cognition, and AI signals.
3. Cross-reference each dataset with its narrative counterpart in `docs/` and solver usage in `models/`.
