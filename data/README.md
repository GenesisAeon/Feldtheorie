# Data Resonance Archive

## RepoPlan 2.0 Mandate
`data/` preserves the cross-domain signals that reveal threshold crossings.  Each dataset must annotate the control parameter $R$, critical threshold $\Theta$, steepness $\beta$, logistic response $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$, and the impedance context $\zeta(R)$.

## Tri-layer Cadence
- **Formal:** document preprocessing steps, units, and membrane boundary assumptions.
- **Empirical:** link to analyses demonstrating resonance onset, including falsification comparisons with smooth null models.
- **Metaphorical:** note the imagery—spiraling accretion discs, swarm murmurs, learning thresholds—that accompanies each dataset.

## Immediate Construction Lines
1. Establish a metadata schema capturing threshold parameters, provenance, and falsification notes.
2. Stage placeholder subdirectories for astrophysics, biology, cognition, and AI signals.
3. Cross-reference each dataset with its narrative counterpart in `docs/` and solver usage in `models/`.

## Current Resonance Caches
- **Astrophysics membrane rehearsal:** `astrophysics/qpo_membrane_simulation.json` and its metadata trace \(R\) surging past \(\Theta = 0.82\) with \(\beta = 9.5\), accompanied by impedance switches detailed in `analysis/reports/qpo_membrane_summary.json`.
- **Honeybee waggle dawn:** `biology/honeybee_waggle_activation.csv` couples nectar sweetness \(R\) to recruitment probability, with metadata and analysis confirming logistic supremacy over linear + power-law nulls.
- **Multilingual reasoning aurora:** `ai/llm_emergent_skill.csv` charts log-token scale \(R\) versus chain-of-thought success, with metadata documenting \(\Theta \approx 4.71\), \(\beta \approx 5.10\), and impedance slackening \(\zeta(R) = 1.6 - 0.45\sigma\).
