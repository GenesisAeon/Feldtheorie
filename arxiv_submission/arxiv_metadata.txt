ABSTRACT:
---------
We analyze threshold transitions across astrophysics, climate, biology, and synthetic intelligence using logistic response curves σ(β(R-Θ)). Across multiple domains, we observe steepness parameters β clustering in the range 3.5-4.8 (median β = 4.2), with ΔAIC > 10 against power-law and linear null models indicating strong support for sigmoidal transitions. We introduce the Universal Threshold Field Model (UTAC) framework that parameterizes critical thresholds (Θ) and impedance dynamics (ζ(R)). Analyzed systems include black hole quasi-periodic oscillations, climate tipping elements (AMOC, Greenland ice sheet, Amazon rainforest), biological swarm dynamics, and emergent capabilities in large language models. While β heterogeneity across domains (range 3.47-12.28) suggests domain-specific mechanisms, convergent values in several systems motivate further investigation of potential universal scaling laws. Code, data, and full analysis pipeline are openly available at https://github.com/GenesisAeon/Feldtheorie (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17472834).
