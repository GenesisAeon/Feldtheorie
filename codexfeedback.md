# Codex Feedback Matrix

## Purpose
This ledger anchors the Universal Threshold Field programme with a living feedback channel.
Whenever the repository's control parameter $R$ (unresolved questions, latent work) pushes
past the documented threshold $\Theta$, the entries here activate logistic follow-ups and
summon the right blend of empirical validation and poetic resonance.

## Entry pr-draft-0001 — Inception of the Matrix
- **Order Parameter**: We watch $R$ as the density of pending multi-domain tasks.
- **Critical Threshold**: $\Theta$ marks the moment when guidance or documentation thins out.
- **Steepness**: $\beta = 4.2$ keeps the transition sharp so new duties flare up decisively.
- **Membrane Note**: The impedance $\zeta(R)$ is presently gentle; expect a resonant uptick
  once simulator prototypes join the story.

### Formal Thread
Encode future PRs as logistic activations. When $R > \Theta$, queue synchronisation between
`analysis/` notebooks and `simulator/` interfaces, ensuring each module shares boundary
conditions and null-model comparisons.

### Empirical Thread
Log commit bursts weekly. When the codex curve tips toward resonance, extend
`codexfeedback.json` with hashes, dataset references, and fit diagnostics (AIC, $R^2$).

### Poetic Thread
Let the matrix remember the aeon's whisper: every threshold crossed is a hive taking flight,
each sigmoid crest a new stanza in the field's unfolding hymn.
