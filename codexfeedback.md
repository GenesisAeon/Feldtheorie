# Codex Feedback Matrix

## Purpose
This ledger anchors the Universal Threshold Field programme with a living feedback channel.
Whenever the repository's control parameter $R$ (unresolved questions, latent work) pushes
past the documented threshold $\Theta$, the entries here activate logistic follow-ups and
summon the right blend of empirical validation and poetic resonance.

## Entry pr-draft-0001 — Inception of the Matrix
- **Order Parameter**: We watch $R$ as the density of pending multi-domain tasks.
- **Critical Threshold**: $\Theta$ marks the moment when guidance or documentation thins out.
- **Steepness**: $\beta = 4.2$ keeps the transition sharp so new duties flare up decisively.
- **Membrane Note**: The impedance $\zeta(R)$ is presently gentle; expect a resonant uptick
  once simulator prototypes join the story.

### Formal Thread
Encode future PRs as logistic activations. When $R > \Theta$, queue synchronisation between
`analysis/` notebooks and `simulator/` interfaces, ensuring each module shares boundary
conditions and null-model comparisons.

### Empirical Thread
Log commit bursts weekly. When the codex curve tips toward resonance, extend
`codexfeedback.json` with hashes, dataset references, and fit diagnostics (AIC, $R^2$).

### Poetic Thread
Let the matrix remember the aeon's whisper: every threshold crossed is a hive taking flight,
each sigmoid crest a new stanza in the field's unfolding hymn.

## Entry pr-draft-0002 — Harmonics for Data-Model Coupling
- **Order Parameter**: $R$ now traces cross-domain artefacts awaiting impedance annotation.
- **Critical Threshold**: $\Theta$ becomes the minimum tri-layer link between `data/` metadata,
  `models/` membranes, and the narrative filaments in `docs/`.
- **Steepness**: $\beta = 5.1$ so that alignment snaps on swiftly once two strands connect.
- **Membrane Note**: Tune $\zeta(R)$ to highlight where datasets lack null-model pairings;
  the membrane should glow whenever a logistic fit proceeds without a falsification twin.

### Formal Thread
Draft interface contracts mapping every dataset's $(R, \Theta, \beta)$ tuple to its
companion model. Specify how boundary conditions propagate into simulator controls,
and record these correspondences in `data/*/AGENTS.md` addenda.

### Empirical Thread
Spin up lightweight notebooks to estimate goodness-of-fit deltas between logistic and
power-law baselines. Once results exceed the resonance score, emit structured entries
in `codexfeedback.json` and schedule replication checks.

### Poetic Thread
Let the coupling hymn braid bee-flight, quake-echo, and LLM murmur into a single
resonant chord—when the membrane hums, we remember that every sigmoid is a promise
of dawn above the threshold.

## Entry pr-draft-0003 — LLM Logistic Resonance Cartography
- **Order Parameter**: $R$ is the curriculum entropy weighted token flux driving gradient tides.
- **Critical Threshold**: $\Theta$ marks the onset of reasoning coherence within validation dialogues.
- **Steepness**: $\beta = 4.8$ captures how sharply competence blooms once feedback loops align.
- **Membrane Note**: $\zeta(R)$ observes the impedance between pretraining momentum and fine-tuning echoes; lowering it invites resonant instruction tuning.

### Formal Thread
Bind `docs/ai/llm-threshold-training.md` to solver implementations so the logistic fit and its null-model twin travel together. Parameter surfaces should flow into simulator sliders for curriculum entropy and impedance.

### Empirical Thread
Commission `analysis/llm-threshold-survey.ipynb` to log $R^2$, AIC, and confidence intervals for $(R, \Theta, \beta)$. Populate `data/ai/` with the accompanying membrane metadata and ethical notes.

### Poetic Thread
When validation dialogues steady into luminous coherence, note the polyglot dawn. Each resonant answer is the membrane's song, reminding us that emergence demands guardianship.

## Entry pr-draft-0004 — Universal Threshold Preprint Weave
- **Order Parameter**: $R$ tallies manuscript sections awaiting tri-layer articulation across the repo.
- **Critical Threshold**: $\Theta$ manifests once the preprint outline binds solver equations, empirical ledgers, and narrative cadence.
- **Steepness**: $\beta = 5.6$ ensures the writing sprint ignites decisively when the outline coheres.
- **Membrane Note**: Tune $\zeta(R)$ to spotlight sections lacking null-model companions; the manuscript membrane should glow when falsifiability breathes alongside poetry.

### Formal Thread
Extend `docs/universal-threshold-preprint-outline.md` with explicit references to `analysis/resonance_fit_pipeline.py`, `models/membrane_solver.py`, and simulator impedance controls. Declare the Euler stride and its null-model comparisons in the introductory equations.

### Empirical Thread
Audit the case studies against `analysis/results/*` JSON ledgers, threading AIC and confidence intervals into the preprint tables. Capture replication hooks and outstanding datasets inside `codexfeedback.json` observables.

### Poetic Thread
Let the manuscript breathe like a dawn-lit membrane where astrophysical pulses, bee dances, and cognitive sparks converge. Each completed section is a threshold crossing that invites readers to hear the field singing.
