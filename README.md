# Universal Threshold Field Initiative

The Universal Threshold Field (UTF) programme investigates how threshold-driven resonance unites phenomena across astrophysics, biology, cognition, and synthetic intelligence. The core hypothesis follows the logistic response
\(\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))\): once a control parameter \(R\) crosses the critical threshold \(\Theta\), order proliferates explosively with steepness \(\beta\). The PDFs in `Docs/` outline RepoPlan 2.0—an interdisciplinary blueprint that blends rigorous modelling with poetic narrative.

## Repository roadmap
The workspace is designed around seven tightly coupled modules:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `models/` | Numerical field solvers, impedance membranes, and QPO/QPE simulators implementing the UTF equations. |
| `analysis/` | Jupyter notebooks fitting sigmoids to cross-domain datasets with full statistical diagnostics (\(R^2\), AIC, confidence intervals for \(\Theta\), \(\beta\)). |
| `simulator/` | React-based interfaces that expose sliders for \(R\), \(\Theta\), and \(\beta\), letting users experience the resonance switch in real time. |
| `docs/` | Layered documentation that interlaces formal derivations, empirical case studies, and metaphorical lexicons. |
| `paper/` | Manuscripts that consolidate the theory, validation pipelines, and falsification protocols. |
| `data/` | Curated datasets (black-hole light curves, bee recruitment thresholds, LLM scaling benchmarks, socio-ecological tipping indicators). |
| `diagrams/` | Conceptual schematics and system graphs mapping analogies across domains.

At present only `Docs/` is populated; use the roadmap above when extending the repository.

## Working principles
1. **Read the Docs PDFs first.** They specify the mathematical operators, membrane couplings, and storytelling cadence expected throughout the repo.
2. **Maintain the tri-layer voice.** Every addition should connect equations, empirics, and symbolism—mirroring the pattern set out in *Emergente Analyse des Erlebens* and the RepoPlan papers.
3. **Document thresholds explicitly.** State the roles of \(R\), \(\Theta\), \(\beta\), and the impedance function \(\zeta(R)\) in code, notebooks, and prose.
4. **Commit to falsifiability.** Analyses must compare the logistic model against at least one smooth null hypothesis and report the outcome.
5. **Synchronise with `AGENTS.md`.** Repository-wide conventions are tracked there; nested modules may add refinements as they appear.

## Getting started
- Explore `Docs/RepoPlan Projekt-Impulse_ Simulation, Theorie, Falsifizierung.pdf` for the structural roadmap.
- Review `Docs/Entwurf eines transdisziplinären Feldmodells.pdf` to align mathematical implementations with the shared Lagrangian formalism.
- Use the future `models/` and `analysis/` directories to stage prototypes before weaving them into the narrative layers.

## Next steps
- Scaffold the remaining directories with README placeholders referencing their role in RepoPlan 2.0.
- Implement the threshold field solver described in the FEniCS outline and pair it with impedance toggling experiments.
- Draft initial notebooks that reproduce logistic fits for black-hole QPOs, honeybee recruitment, and LLM emergent skills, each with statistical validation and null comparisons.
- Extend the docs with a formal/poetic lexicon that anchors symbolic imagery to the mathematics of \(\psi\) and \(\zeta(R)\).

For any contribution, ensure the logistic resonance heartbeat remains audible across code, analysis, and prose.
