title: "Universal Threshold Field Initiative"
abstract: >-
  The Universal Threshold Field (UTF) programme braids astrophysical, biological,
  cognitive, climatic, and synthetic intelligence data into a shared logistic
  resonance. Every contribution foregrounds the quartet (R, Θ, β, ζ(R)) and the
  switch-like response σ(β(R-Θ)) that drives emergent order beyond critical
  thresholds. Version 1.0.1 now aligns Jason Wei's emergent-ability lanterns with
  the canonical β≈4.2 band while preserving the semantic coupling braid M[ψ, φ]
  so controlled emergence experiments inherit the same reproducible membrane cadence.
