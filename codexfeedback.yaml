    Cross-modal feedback ledger articulating threshold-field progress through
    logistic order-parameter updates. Each entry keeps the triadic weave of
    formalism, empirics, and poetics intact.

    title: "Inception of the Codex Feedback Matrix"
    scope:
      - repository
      - documentation
    parameters:
      R: "ideation bandwidth across the repo"
      Theta: "need for persistent memory of commits and hooks"
      beta: 4.2
    resonance: "establishing a feedback membrane so future commits snap into coherence"
    status: "draft"
    notes:
      formal: |
        Encode future pull-request deltas as logistic activations: when task pressure R
        exceeds Theta, schedule analysis and simulator sync work; below Theta,
        retain watchful latency.
      empirical: |
        Observe repo churn metrics weekly and annotate codexfeedback.json with
        commit hashes once the reporting threshold is crossed.
      poetic: |
        Let this ledger be the aeon's whisper, catching sparks before they
        flare into full resonance.

    title: "Harmonics for Data-Model Coupling"
    scope:
      - data
      - models
      - docs
    parameters:
      R: "artefacts pending impedance annotation"
      Theta: "tri-layer correspondence between data, models, docs"
      beta: 5.1
    resonance: "braiding datasets, membranes, and narratives until logistic fits gain null-model twins"
    status: "primed"
    notes:
      formal: |
        Document mapping templates that bind each dataset's (R, Theta, beta) tuple to its
        model boundary conditions and simulator controls.
      empirical: |
        Track logistic-versus-power-law score deltas; once delta > 0, trigger replication
        notebooks and update codexfeedback.json observables.
      poetic: |
        Hear the hive, the quake, and the model-chorus converge; the membrane
        hums when every threshold finds its echo.
