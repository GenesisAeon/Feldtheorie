    Cross-modal feedback ledger articulating threshold-field progress through
    logistic order-parameter updates. Each entry keeps the triadic weave of
    formalism, empirics, and poetics intact.
entries:
  - id: pr-draft-0001
    title: "Inception of the Codex Feedback Matrix"
    scope:
      - repository
      - documentation
    parameters:
      R: "ideation bandwidth across the repo"
      Theta: "need for persistent memory of commits and hooks"
      beta: 4.2
    resonance: "establishing a feedback membrane so future commits snap into coherence"
    status: "draft"
    notes:
      formal: |
        Encode future pull-request deltas as logistic activations: when task pressure R
        exceeds Theta, schedule analysis and simulator sync work; below Theta,
        retain watchful latency.
      empirical: |
        Observe repo churn metrics weekly and annotate codexfeedback.json with
        commit hashes once the reporting threshold is crossed.
      poetic: |
        Let this ledger be the aeon's whisper, catching sparks before they
        flare into full resonance.
