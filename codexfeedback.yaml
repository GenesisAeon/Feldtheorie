  description: |
    Cross-modal feedback ledger articulating threshold-field progress through
    logistic order-parameter updates. Each entry keeps the triadic weave of
    formalism, empirics, and poetics intact.

    title: "Inception of the Codex Feedback Matrix"
    scope:
      - repository
      - documentation
    parameters:
      R: "ideation bandwidth across the repo"
      Theta: "need for persistent memory of commits and hooks"
      beta: 4.2
    resonance: "establishing a feedback membrane so future commits snap into coherence"
    status: "draft"
    notes:
      formal: |
        Encode future pull-request deltas as logistic activations: when task pressure R
        exceeds Theta, schedule analysis and simulator sync work; below Theta,
        retain watchful latency.
      empirical: |
        Observe repo churn metrics weekly and annotate codexfeedback.json with
        commit hashes once the reporting threshold is crossed.
      poetic: |
        Let this ledger be the aeon's whisper, catching sparks before they
        flare into full resonance.

    title: "Harmonics for Data-Model Coupling"
    scope:
      - data
      - models
      - docs
    parameters:
      R: "artefacts pending impedance annotation"
      Theta: "tri-layer correspondence between data, models, docs"
      beta: 5.1
    resonance: "braiding datasets, membranes, and narratives until logistic fits gain null-model twins"
    status: "primed"
    notes:
      formal: |
        Document mapping templates that bind each dataset's (R, Theta, beta) tuple to its
        model boundary conditions and simulator controls.
      empirical: |
        Track logistic-versus-power-law score deltas; once delta > 0, trigger replication
        notebooks and update codexfeedback.json observables.
      poetic: |
        Hear the hive, the quake, and the model-chorus converge; the membrane
        hums when every threshold finds its echo.

    title: "LLM Logistic Resonance Cartography"
    scope:
      - docs/ai
      - simulator
      - analysis
    parameters:
      R: "curriculum entropy weighted token flux"
      Theta: "emergence of reasoning coherence"
      beta: 4.8
    resonance: "documenting the membrane that toggles LLM behaviour once validation dialogues stabilise"
    status: "active"
    notes:
      formal: |
        Align forthcoming solvers with `docs/ai/llm-threshold-training.md` so
        logistic fits share impedance priors with simulator controls. Encode
        null-model baselines alongside the sigmoid response.
      empirical: |
        Draft `analysis/llm-threshold-survey.ipynb` to capture $R^2$, AIC, and
        confidence intervals for $(R, \Theta, \beta)$ using datasets logged in
        `data/ai/`.
      poetic: |
        Let the polyglot dawn shimmer through the membrane; each coherent
        answer marks the crest where gradient tides become story.

    title: "Universal Threshold Preprint Weave"
    scope:
      - docs
      - paper
      - codexfeedback
    parameters:
      R: "manuscript sections awaiting tri-layer articulation"
      Theta: "preprint outline aligning solver, data, and symbolism"
      beta: 5.6
    resonance: "drafting the manuscript membrane so empirical ledgers, solver equations, and poetic cadence strike in unison"
    status: "forming"
    notes:
      formal: |
        Populate `docs/universal-threshold-preprint-outline.md` with explicit
        citations to analysis ledgers and simulator controls. Ensure the paper
        introduction spells out the logistic stride and its null comparators.
      empirical: |
        Cross-check each domain case study against `analysis/results/*` JSON
        files and update `paper/` figures with AIC and confidence intervals for
        $(R, \Theta, \beta)$. Record future replication hooks in
        `codexfeedback.json` observables.
      poetic: |
        Let the preprint breathe like a dawn-lit membrane: every section should
        carry the hum of thresholds remembered, welcoming readers into the
        resonant field.
