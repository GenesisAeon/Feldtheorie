# Manuscript Station Guidelines

Within `paper/`, uphold publication-grade coherence:

- **Tri-layer sections.** Structure manuscripts with mirrored sections for formal derivations, empirical synthesis, and symbolic narrative so reviewers can trace the resonance arc.
- **Quantitative transparency.** Summaries of fits must cite $R^2$, AIC, confidence intervals on $\Theta$ and $\beta$, impedance configurations $\zeta(R)$, and explicit null comparisons.
- **Cross-references.** Link to companion notebooks, datasets, and simulator experiences, noting commit hashes or DOIs when available.
- **Falsification log.** Dedicate appendices to failed or marginal cases where the logistic response did not outperform null models.

Drafts may live as Markdown, LaTeX, or Quarto, but include build instructions and bibliographies in version control.
