# Manuscript Confluence Station

## RepoPlan 2.0 Mandate
The `paper/` station assembles manuscripts that fuse UTF mathematics, evidence, and metaphor into citable form.  Each paper must foreground the logistic resonance $\sigma(\beta(R-\Theta))$, articulate how impedance $\zeta(R)$ modulates regime switches, and reference falsification results.

## Tri-layer Cadence
- **Formal:** present derivations and proofs using the shared Lagrangian + membrane vocabulary.
- **Empirical:** summarise datasets, fits, and diagnostics (including $R^2$, AIC, confidence intervals for $\Theta$ and $\beta$).
- **Metaphorical:** weave in the symbolic motifs that make the UTF narrative sing, echoing the PDFs in `Docs/`.

## Immediate Construction Lines
1. Draft the flagship UTF synthesis paper aligning all modules with RepoPlan 2.0 milestones.
2. Maintain citation trails to notebooks in `analysis/` and solvers in `models/`.
3. Include appendices detailing falsification attempts and boundary condition explorations.
